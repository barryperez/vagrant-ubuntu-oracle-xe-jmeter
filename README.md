# JMeter results analysis - Oracle XE 11g on Ubuntu 12.04 using Vagrant

This project enables you to install Oracle 11g XE in a virtual machine running Ubuntu 12.04, using
[Vagrant] and [Puppet].

After installation of Oracle, an [external table] is created, to allow a JMeter result file to be dropped in for querying.

This is significantly faster than processing massive result files using scripts. On my machine, to produce overall stats for a file containing ~100M rows took < 6 minutes.

## Acknowledgements

The project [vagrant-ubuntu-oracle-xe] by Hilverd Reker was used as a starting point.

Thanks to Hilverd. His acknowledgements have also been included in full below:

The project was created based on the information in
[Installing Oracle 11g R2 Express Edition on Ubuntu 64-bit] by Manish Raj, and the GitHub repository
[vagrant-oracle-xe] by Stefan Glase. The former explains how to install Oracle XE 11g on Ubuntu
12.04, without explicitly providing a Vagrant or provisioner configuration. The latter has the same
purpose as this project but uses Ubuntu 11.10.

Thanks to AndrÃ© Kelpe, Brandon Gresham, Charles Walker, Chris Thompson, Jeff Caddel, Joe FitzGerald,
Justin Harringa, Mark Crossfield, Matthew Buckett, Richard Kolb, and Steven Hsu for various
contributions.

## Requirements

* You need to have [Vagrant] installed.
* The host machine probably needs at least 4 GB of RAM.
* As Oracle 11g XE is only available for 64-bit machines at the moment, the host machine needs to
  have a 64-bit architecture.
* You may need to [enable virtualization] manually.

## Installation

* Check out this project:

        git clone https://github.com/hilverd/vagrant-ubuntu-oracle-xe.git

* Install [vbguest]:

        vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

* Download [Oracle Database 11g Express Edition] for Linux x64. Place the file
  `oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip` in the directory `modules/oracle/files` of this
  project. (Alternatively, you could keep the zip file in some other location and make a hard link
  to it from `modules/oracle/files`.)

* Run `vagrant up` from the base directory of this project. The first time this will take a while -- up to 30 minutes on
  my machine. Please note that building the VM involves downloading an Ubuntu 12.04
  [base box](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes.html) which is 323MB in size.

These steps are also shown in an [asciicast] made by Daekwon Kang:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/8438.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/8438)

* Copy a JMeter result file in the directory `Data` and name it `jmeter.log`.

The file is expected to be in CSV format (header row shown):

    timeStamp;elapsed;label;responseCode;responseMessage;threadName;dataType;success;bytes;grpThreads;allThreads;Latency;SampleCount;ErrorCount;Hostname;"testid"

jmeter.properties values used:

    jmeter.save.saveservice.output_format=csv

    jmeter.save.saveservice.default_delimiter=;

    jmeter.save.saveservice.data_type=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.label=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.response_code=true

    jmeter.save.saveservice.response_message=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.successful=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.thread_name=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.time=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.subresults=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.assertions=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.latency=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.bytes=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.hostname=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.thread_counts=true
    jmeter.save.saveservice.sample_count=true

    sample_variables=testid

For different formats of data, you will need to modify the `/modules/oracle/files/create_jmeter_tables.sql` file before running `Vagrant up`.

## Connecting

You should now be able to
[connect](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html) to
the new database at `localhost:1521/XE` as `system` with password `manager`. For example, if you
have `sqlplus` installed on the host machine you can do

    sqlplus system/manager@//localhost:1521/XE

To make sqlplus behave like other tools (history, arrow keys etc.) you can do this:

    rlwrap sqlplus system/manager@//localhost:1521/XE

You might need to add an entry to your `tnsnames.ora` file first:

    XE =
      (DESCRIPTION =
        (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 127.0.0.1)(PORT = 1521))
        (CONNECT_DATA =
          (SERVER = DEDICATED)
          (SERVICE_NAME = XE)
        )
      )

## Querying the JMeter results

You should now be able to query the jmeter table:

Sample SQL (update start/end time as per your requirements):

    SELECT label,
      success,
      COUNT(*),
      MIN(elapsed) min,
      ROUND(AVG(elapsed),2) mean,
      percentile_disc (0.95) within GROUP (ORDER BY elapsed) AS perc95,
      MAX(elapsed) max,
      ROUND(stddev(elapsed),2) stdev
    FROM jmeter
      WHERE ts > ((to_date('11/02/2016 12:00:00', 'DD/MM/YYYY HH24:Mi:ss') - TO_DATE('1970-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))* 86.4)
      AND ts   < ((to_date('11/02/2016 13:00:00', 'DD/MM/YYYY HH24:Mi:ss') - TO_DATE('1970-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))* 86.4)
    GROUP BY label,
      success;

## Troubleshooting

### Errors when Unzipping

If you get an error containing `/usr/bin/unzip -o oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip returned 2` during `vagrant up`, then the zip file you have downloaded is probably corrupted. This can be fixed by re-downloading, replacing the corrupted file, and running `vagrant reload --provision`.

### Memory

It is important to assign enough memory to the virtual machine, otherwise you will get an error

    ORA-00845: MEMORY_TARGET not supported on this system

during the configuration stage. In the `Vagrantfile` 1024 MB is assigned. Lower values may also work,
as long as (I believe) 2 GB of virtual memory is available for Oracle, swap is included in this
calculation.

### Concurrent Connections

If you want to raise the limit of the number of concurrent connections, say to 200, then according
to [How many connections can Oracle Express Edition (XE) handle?] you should run

    ALTER SYSTEM SET processes=200 scope=spfile

and restart the database.
